# Mastermind
Player A will decide the order of numbers to be broken by player B.
Player B will then need to make consecutive guesses to try and break the code created by player A.
 - If player B correctly guesses the number and its position, they will receive a black peg.
 - If player B correctly guesses the number, but the position is wrong, they will receive a white peg.
